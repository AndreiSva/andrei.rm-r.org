# 2024

Whoooo first post of the new year! I am five days late but I have just sort of been sleeping for the past few days.

I am about to start my second semester at SFU next week. I was hoping I could have been more productive during my break but it is what it is. If this year is half as good as last year then I'm gonna have a great time. Though I wish it will be better, just for the sake of progression.
