# First Entry

wow this is such a cool first entry in my brand new journal, i wonder what kind of new exciting adventures await!

This is the fourth (?) iteration of my website, but I think I am pretty satisfied with how it turned out this time. I wrote it from scratch using Sveltekit. Now the codebase is a lot better looking than the non-framework mess it was before. Writing journals is a breeze, because every entry is written in markdown and rendered on the server using the [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) library.
