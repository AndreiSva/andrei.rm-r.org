# Summer

I can't believe it's essentially already July. Today I migrated most of my services over from Azure to a Vultr VM. I was sort of fed up with how Azure handled IPv6.

I also recently finished another semester of school and will be taking the next one as a break over the summer. I have plans to read some textbooks and write some software. I feel like I need to do something big and impressive.
