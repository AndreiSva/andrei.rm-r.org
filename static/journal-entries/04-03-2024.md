# Idk

I have been switching to and from GNOME and sway constantly for the past few months, but now I have a cool colorscheme set up and will hopefully stay with sway.

Other than that my life has been pretty boring, mostly just working on school and on a chat server I am calling prosperity, though I haven't even worked on that for a while...
