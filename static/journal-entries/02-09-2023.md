# Plastic Shards

Today i found plastic shards in my milkshake. I told the waiter but didn't make a big deal. They gave me a discount but still, it was pretty annoying.

Also, today I worked on this website some more, it's looking better by the day. Even if I make a lot of use of javascript, I'm trying to keep the crucial content itself onto the server, so it's viewable from more minimalistic browsers.
