# The Future

I realized I haven't made one of these in a while. In a nutshell, life has been
going pretty good. I have been mosting working on getting accustomed to my new
university and on doing homework.

Now that that's out of the way I wanted to speak about the future. A lot of
people think the future is going to be very grim. I think that, even if the
ongoing crises have the potential to cause real economic and societal damage,
the chance for human exctinction in the next 100 years is essentially 0.

I generally also have a positive outlook of my own future. I feel pretty
comfident that I will do a lot of greats things looking forward.
