# start.rm-r.org

I have made a small page that is up at [start.rm-r.org](https://start.rm-r.org). It's not very customizeable as of now, but it might be in the future. I made it in vanilla CSS trying to use the most "modern" CSS features that I could, including the new CSS nesting syntax.

It is really unfortunate that we have to be backwards compatible. I really feel like it reduces the elegance of software and protocols by a lot.

The past few weeks have been mostly uneventful. I have transfered to UBC which is pretty cool. In the next few months I want to focus on learning more linear algebra and networking systems. Of course programming is always something that I try to get better at as well.

In July I will also potentially go to Europe, which could be interesting.
