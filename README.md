## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
